1. Cancel_account.py:  

This script is similar to our assignment Challenge 8 and 9. I am using this for Canceling Sling account. Where 3 different API calls (GET and POST method) required.
Parsing the results from one API and passing them as parameter for next API.


2. url_redirect.py: 
This script is similar to our assignment Challenge 10.
This script is reading data from and writing data to excel sheet. Excel is having Base URL and expected redirected URL. 
Reading Base URL, launching it through request call and checking if redirect is successful or not and also response code (e.g. 404 etc.). Capturing results in same sheet.


3. Signup_*.html files: 
This is similar to our assignment Challenge 12.
I have created some automation scripts for some sling website flow like creating new account (Signup), sign-in to slings etc. There were some 7 end to end use cases automated as of now.
I have attached my sample result report and log file. I have use Robot Framework and used Python for all selenium web driver stuff. If required I can share the code.

Please note, I have changed some api and url links to like dummy (XXX) due to confidentiality in above scripts. Please do not share this further.
